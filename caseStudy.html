            A Case Study for the FilmFan App
        </h1>
        <img src="img/filmFanOptimized.gif" alt="Gif of many different views of the filmFan App" class="case_study">
        <h2 class="case">Overview</h2>
        <p class="case">
            FilmFan is the first app I built using React! It provides users 
            with access to information about movies. Users are able to sign 
            up, update their personal information and create a list of their 
            favorite movies. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="case">Purpose & Context</h2>
        <p class="case">
            FilmFan was a project assigned to me as part of a full-stack web 
            development course at CareerFoundry. It was designed to improve 
            my abilities working with node.js, React, JavaScript and Client/Server 
            architecture.
        </p>
        <img src="img/mobile.png" class="right"/>
        <h2 class="case">Objective</h2>
        <p class="case">
            The goal of the project was to build the Server side and Client 
            side for a web application with a movie theme. It was built completely 
            from scratch to demonstrate my understanding of both Server/Client 
            sides and best principles of RESTful web development. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="case">Approach</h2>
        
        <h3 class="case">Server-Side</h3>
        <p class="case">
            I first created the Server side of the app. This consists of the API 
            itself, and a database on MongoDB. I had some familiarity with API’s 
            and databases before starting but this project made me stretch by 
            requiring the use of new-to-me technologies like Node.js and Express. 
            It’s also the first time I had to implement authentication and 
            authorization on a server. Testing in Postman and using a lot of 
            console.logs was key to my success in creating the Server-Side. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="case">Client-Side</h3>
        <p class="case">
            The next part of the process was to build out the Client-Side of 
            the app using React. Every technology I used for this was new to 
            me including using Parcel as a build tool, state routing to navigate 
            between views, and using React Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness. 
            This step was the one where I experienced the most challenges throughout 
            FilmFan’s development process. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="case">Challenges</h2>
        <p class="case">
            My biggest challenge was in connecting the dots between client and server. 
            There were times where I felt like I knew what the code was supposed to 
            do but couldn’t figure out how to get the right information to the right 
            part of the app. I also had issues understanding how UseState and Props 
            worked in React. With any of these challenges I would usually try to 
            re-read the instructions or course reading and try figuring it out from 
            those. If that didn’t work I would turn to the internet for answers 
            from forums or preferably documentation of the technologies I was using. 
            If and when that failed, I would schedule a call with my mentor to help 
            me figure things out. Before the call I would make sure I understood 
            as much as possible and was able to replicate my issues and that was 
            usually all that was required to get the help I needed. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="case">Conclusion</h2>
        <p class="case">
            I really enjoyed working on this project. There were certainly times 
            where I struggled to wrap my head around all the new technology and 
            techniques I was learning but I’m glad I completed it and now have a 
            good-looking, functional, full-stack web app in my repertoire.
